# DIDIY Case

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HTangl/DIDIY-Case/main/Pictures/DIDIY%20Case%20Front.jpg)  

The DIDIY case is a layered case design specifically made for the DIDIY board. It uses the **[HTangl layout](https://www.htangl.com/details)**.  

For a video guide on how to assemble the case please visit the [HTangl YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIHJYzL-LAS2CVR-Q0J305w)
 
You can use the DXF files in this repository to order all the panels needed from a laser cutting website like [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/). There are definitely other websites you can get the panels from but I am most familiar with SCS and have been ordering from them without issue for several months.  

### Hardware ###  

For hardware you will need the following:  
7 - Case Screws - M5 x 0.80mm, 25mm Long  
7 - Case Nuts - M5 x 0.8 mm Weld Nuts  
4 - DIDIY Mounting Screws - M3 x 0.5mm, 8mm Long

You can buy this hardware from me in a pack on my [Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/HTangl) but if you'd prefer to source everything yourself below are links to the needed hardware on both McMaster-Carr and Amazon. McMaster will be higher quality but more expensive.

**Step 3**  
Open the DXF folder you downloaded in step 1 and drag one of the files onto the page to begin the ordering process, I started with the bottom panel.

**Step 5**  
We now need to select what material to use for this panel, refrenece the list at the start of this guide to determine which material/thickness/quantity to select.

 **Step 6**  
 Once you reach this screen click "ADD TO CART", you will then get a notification that the item was added to your cart. You'll then need to click on "ADD MORE DRAWINGS", this will take you back to the screen you were at in step 4. All you need to do now is drag another DXF file onto the window and repeat the process for all the remaining panels.

Please keep in mind that if you choose to deviate from the recommended material/thickness/quantity of any of these parts the case may not work with the recommended hardware or might not have enough space for the componenets/wiring to fit inside. Generally it's okay to change the type of material but I recommend sticking to the listed thickness/quantity for each panel.
